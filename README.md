# Sathi
 A Slack bot that's being developed to automatically scrape the web and post relevant internships in Washington
 
 Dev notes:
 -DO NOT COMMIT ANYTHING TO THE MASTER BRANCH WITHOUT CONSULTING EVERYONE IN THE GROUP
 -Don't merge any of the branches with master until the project is done
 -Make sure to document out code well, you never know when you have to go back and touch it again
